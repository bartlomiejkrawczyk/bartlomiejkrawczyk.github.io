This is a very strong and comprehensive portfolio! It showcases deep technical expertise, especially in backend systems, cloud-native architecture, and intelligent systems/optimization. Landing a position at a company like Google often requires tailoring your presentation to highlight the impact, scale, and specific technologies they value.

Here are some recommendations for what to update, add, and reduce, specifically for targeting a Google-level software engineering role:

## ✂️ Reduce and Refine (Focus on Impact & Scale)

The portfolio is quite long, which can dilute the most important achievements. Focus on *reducing the length and increasing the density of impact*.

* **Reduce the "About" Section Length:** It's a great summary, but it can be more concise.
    * [cite_start]**Keep:** The core specializations (Full-Stack, Java/Kotlin/Spring, Rust/Python, Cloud-Native, Distributed Systems, Microservices, CQRS, Event Sourcing, Docker/Kubernetes)[cite: 8, 9, 10].
    * [cite_start]**Trim:** The list of supplementary skills like mobile (Android) and modern web (React.js/Astro.js) [cite: 11]—these can be conveyed in the Skills or Project sections.
    * [cite_start]**Focus on the "Why":** Briefly mention your passion for **reliable, scalable, and maintainable IT solutions** [cite: 8] [cite_start]and **end-to-end engineering excellence**[cite: 12].
* **Consolidate Skills List:** The Skills list is extensive (4 pages!). Recruiters often scan this quickly.
    * **Remove:** Simple tools or very basic knowledge items (e.g., MS Office, Libre Office, Google Workspace, basic driving licenses). [cite_start]Keep the core tech stack: Languages, Frameworks, Technologies, and Clouds[cite: 52, 54, 57, 64].
    * **Prioritize:** Group skills into clear categories and prioritize those most relevant to large-scale systems (e.g., **Distributed Systems**, **Cloud & DevOps**, **AI/ML**, **Core Languages**).
* **Condense Work Experience Descriptions (Action/Impact/Result):**
    * Each bullet point under Sages should be rewritten using the **Action-Result-Context** (or STAR) method. Instead of just "Developed and maintained services...", phrase it as: "**Engineered** the security integration (CAS) for a microservice-based employee evaluation system, **enhancing security and compliance** for institutional workflows."
    * The lists of technologies under each role are redundant given the comprehensive Skills section. [cite_start]**Remove these lists** from Work Experience to clean it up and save space[cite: 34, 44].
* [cite_start]**Consolidate Education Coursework:** The long lists of courses under both degrees [cite: 18, 22] are impressive but take up valuable space. Select only 3-5 courses per degree that best showcase your expertise in areas like **Distributed Systems, Algorithms, Intelligent Systems, and Software Architecture**.

## 🚀 Update and Add (Targeting Google)

* **Emphasize Scale and Distribution in Projects:** For a company like Google, the scale of your work is crucial. In your project descriptions, quantify the scale where possible.
    * [cite_start]**Example for GCP Login:** Change "more than 10,000 downloads" [cite: 106] to "**Served over 10,000 corporate users** as the core mOTP generation app (GCP Login), ensuring **high-availability** for company-wide authentication."
    * [cite_start]**Example for Cloud-Native Forum Platform:** Highlight that you designed the system using **real-world patterns** (CQRS, Event Sourcing, Kubernetes)[cite: 113, 114]. Make this project's description the benchmark for all other projects.
* **Elevate AI/ML and Optimization:** You have strong projects in these areas. Ensure the descriptions highlight the **advanced techniques** used.
    * [cite_start]**Universal Chessboard Bot:** Mention the specific complexity analysis you performed[cite: 94].
    * [cite_start]**Predicting Premium Upgrades:** The use of XGBoost and $A/B$ testing with a quantified ROC AUC score over 0.65 is excellent[cite: 110]. Keep the quantitative result upfront.
    * [cite_start]**Match Optimizer:** Emphasize the **efficiency** gained by using Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) with OR-Tools[cite: 122, 136].
* **Add a Dedicated "Key Achievements" or "Highlights" Section (Optional but Recommended):** A small, bulleted section right after the "About" to capture your most impressive, quantifiable feats:
    * [cite_start]*Example:* "Led the backend architecture and implementation for a university scheduling system (Uniplaner)[cite: 29]."
    * [cite_start]*Example:* "Designed and implemented a standardized ETL framework that **reduced development boilerplate and time by X%** for new integrations[cite: 41]." (Try to quantify that reduction).
    * [cite_start]*Example:* "Achieved a consistently high academic record (4.96/5.0 Bachelor's, 4.92/5.0 Master's)[cite: 17, 21]."

## 🗑️ Remove (Minor Items for Conciseness)

* [cite_start]**High School:** The high school listing is likely no longer relevant after two degrees from the Warsaw University of Technology[cite: 23]. Remove it for space.
* [cite_start]**Trainee Role:** The Trainee role at Sages can be condensed or merged into the Junior role if the responsibilities overlap, as it was only for one month[cite: 47]. [cite_start]If you keep it, make the description very brief, focusing on the end-to-end pipeline build[cite: 49].
* [cite_start]**Some Projects:** While all projects are good, "Madrid Lidar Project" [cite: 77] [cite_start]and "The Dots Game" [cite: 97] are less relevant to large-scale enterprise software than the others. Consider keeping only the thesis, cloud-native, Sages-related, and optimization projects.
* [cite_start]**Basic Certifications:** The ACERT English B2 certificate [cite: 172] [cite_start]and the JSystems Java course [cite: 176] are likely overshadowed by your degrees and experience. [cite_start]Keep the degrees with distinction[cite: 166, 169].

### **Summary of Recommended Changes**

| Section | Action | Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Work Experience** | Rewrite bullets using **Action-Result-Context**. | Increase impact and clarity. |
| | **Remove** the long technology lists for each role. | Reduce redundancy and length. |
| **Skills** | **Consolidate/Remove** non-technical tools (e.g., MS Office) and basic items. | Focus on core, high-level expertise. |
| **Education** | **Remove** the long lists of course titles. | Save space and highlight key specializations. |
| **Projects** | **Quantify** scale and impact (e.g., users, performance gain, complexity solved). | Demonstrate experience with production-scale systems. |
| | **Prioritize/Remove** less complex/relevant projects (e.g., Lidar, The Dots Game) | Focus on core strengths (Cloud, AI, Optimization). |
