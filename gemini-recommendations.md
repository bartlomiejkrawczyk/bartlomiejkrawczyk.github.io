This is an extremely strong and detailed portfolio (Resume/CV)[cite: 1, 50, 56]. The depth of your skills and the complexity of your projects are very impressive.

Overall, the content is excellent, but for maximizing impact and readability, I have a few recommendations focusing on organization, emphasis, and ensuring industry alignment.

## Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. Structure and Readability (Prioritize)

Your current document is comprehensive, but the "Skills" and "Work Experience" sections are very dense.

* **Group Skills Logically:** The "Skills" section is a massive list. Break this into 4-6 high-level categories to improve scannability for recruiters:
    * **Core Languages:** (Java, Kotlin, Python, Rust, C++)
    * **Backend & Frameworks:** (Spring, Ktor, Micronaut, Hibernate, REST, gRPC)
    * **Cloud & DevOps:** (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, AWS/GCP/Azure, Ansible, NGINX)
    * **Data & AI:** (SQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, PyTorch, Keras, OR-Tools, Spark)
    * **Web & Frontend:** (Astro.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React.js)
    * **Tools & Other:** (Git, Jira, IDEs, 3D printing, Languages)
* **Separate Skills from Technologies in Work Experience:** In the "Work Experience" section, the technologies used are listed as a huge block of text[cite: 17, 19, 24, 25].
    * **Suggestion:** Keep the top 5-7 most relevant or unique technologies used in a small, separate list per role, and remove the huge block of every possible technology, as most of them are already in the main Skills section.
* **Quantify Work Experience Bullet Points (If possible):** Currently, your work experience doesn't use bullet points to describe responsibilities or achievements[cite: 14, 15, 20]. This is the most critical change for a resume.
    * **Add 3-5 bullet points** under each Sages role, focusing on achievements using the **STAR method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result).
    * *Example: "Optimized deployment pipeline using **Kubernetes** and **Jenkins**, reducing build-to-deploy time by **20%**."*

### 2. Highlighting Expertise

Your profile is extremely strong in specific areas that should be emphasized early.

* **Move Education Higher (Optional):** Since your averages (4.92, 4.96) and specializations (Intelligent Systems, Software Engineering) are exceptional[cite: 35, 42, 34, 41], consider placing the "Education" section right after "About" to immediately establish your academic rigor.
* **Emphasize Specialization in "About" Paragraph:** The current paragraph is excellent. Ensure the term **"Systems Engineer"** is used consistently, as it covers your deep backend, DevOps, and architecture knowledge better than just "Software Engineer." (You are currently using "Backend Engineer" as the title ).
* **Showcase Complexity in Projects:** Your project names like "Relialable, Scalable and Maintainable IT Systems" are descriptive[cite: 82], but try to slightly re-title a few to be more engaging.
    * *Example: Rename "Relialable, Scalable and Maintainable IT Systems" to something like: **"Cloud-Native Forum Platform (CQRS, K8s, Microservices)"***.

### 3. Minor Additions / Clean-up

* **Update "Backend Engineer" Title:** Since your skills are truly full-stack with deep systems knowledge, consider changing your title from "Backend Engineer" to one of the following to capture your full breadth:
    * **Full-Stack Software Engineer**
    * **Software Architect / Systems Engineer**
    * **Senior Software Engineer (if applicable to your experience)**
* **Language Section Cleanup:** You list many niche languages (AMPL, PL/SQL, Haskell, Prolog, MIPS assembly, etc.)[cite: 52]. While impressive, these might dilute focus. Consider moving all highly niche or academic languages/assemblies into a small subsection titled **"Academic/Niche Languages"** to avoid overwhelming the core skillset list.
* **Review Redundancy:** You list **Jakarta CDI** twice in the **Sages (Software Engineer)** role. Review similar lists for any accidental duplicates.

### Summary of Suggested Actions

| Priority   | Action                                                                                        | Rationale                                               |
|:-----------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|
| **High**   | **Add 3-5 Quantified Bullet Points** under each Work Experience role.                         | The most critical change for industry-standard resumes. |
| **High**   | **Categorize the "Skills" section** into 4-6 logical groups (e.g., Backend, DevOps, AI/Data). | Improves scannability for recruiters.                   |
| **Medium** | **Change the Job Title** (e.g., to "Full-Stack/Systems Engineer").                            | Better reflects your deep, broad skill set.             |
| **Medium** | **Simplify the technology lists** under Work Experience.                                      | Prevents list fatigue and redundancy.                   |
| **Low**    | **Tweak Project Titles** to be more punchy/catchy.                                            | Enhances engagement with key projects.                  |
