# I Believe I Can Land

## My First Engineering Project (CanSat 2019)

In 2019, just as I entered high school, I joined a small team that decided to take on the **CanSat competition**-an international challenge where students design, build, and launch a miniature “satellite” the size of a soda can. Even though CanSats don't go to space, they're deployed from ~1 km altitude and must perform real scientific and engineering missions: gather measurements, transmit telemetry, survive landing, and accomplish a self-designed secondary mission.

This became one of my earliest-and most defining-technical projects. It combined software, electronics, mechanics, physics, and a huge amount of trial and error. Our team called the project **“I Believe I Can Land.”**

# Team & Roles

We were a small group of four students, supervised by our IT teacher.

Although we initially divided responsibilities into clear roles, in practice everyone ended up doing everything-coding, testing, wiring, designing, and fixing whatever broke (which was often). It was true hands-on teamwork.

- **Lead Software Engineer - Krzysztof Zbudniewek**  
  Built the full software stack: firmware, Raspberry Pi software, and the ground station.

- **Lead Electrical Engineer - Bartłomiej Jacak**  
  Designed the electrical system, wiring, and the integration of all modules inside the tiny CanSat cylinder.

- **Lead Recovery System Engineer - Bartłomiej Krawczyk (me)**  
  Responsible for modeling, testing, and designing the parachute system, including attempts at a guided parafoil.

- **Software Engineer - Mateusz Kwiatkowski**  
  Involved in developing firmware for the payload.

- **Team Supervisor - Anna Stopińska**  
  Oversaw the project and helped us navigate the competition requirements.

We were a small team-but motivated, curious, and very inexperienced. This project became our crash course in real engineering.

# Mission Objectives

Every CanSat must complete a **primary mission** and a self-designed **secondary mission**.
Our secondary mission was ambitious-far more ambitious than we realized at the time.

## 1. Primary Mission: Telemetry & Environment Data

The CanSat needed to measure:

- temperature (DS18B20 sensor)
- static pressure (BMP280 sensor)
- flight altitude
- frame number / timestamps

Data had to be sent live to the ground station via an ATSAMD21G18-based microcontroller and stored on an SD card for post-flight analysis.

## 2. Secondary Mission: Real-Time Landing Site Classification

Our bold plan was to classify terrain beneath the CanSat during descent to detect areas that were:

- **safe** (fields, grass, open terrain)
- **unsafe** (water, buildings, roads, forests)

<Figure
  src={classification}
  alt="Example classification - https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/daniel-j-h/diary/44145"
  width="80%"
/>

We used:

- a **Raspberry Pi Zero**
- Pi Camera
- a **convolutional neural network (CNN)** built in **PyTorch**

The idea was to:

1. Capture live images during descent
2. Filter out blurry or tilted images using IMU data
3. Correct the perspective
4. Run them through a neural network
5. Build a heat map of suitable landing areas

It was an early exposure to computer vision and embedded ML-long before “edge AI” became mainstream.

## 3. Attempted Tertiary Mission: Guided Landing

Initially, we even wanted to **steer** the payload toward the best landing site using a **parafoil parachute** controlled by servos. This required:

- modeling lift-to-drag ratio
- calculating stable glide paths
- designing multi-line parafoil control
- simulating wind influence

While the idea was scientifically solid, reality reminded us that engineering is hard. After multiple failed prototypes (and many tangled parachutes), we ultimately dropped the guided-landing functionality and switched to a reliable round parachute.

# System Architecture

Our CanSat was effectively a two-computer system:

## Microcontroller (ATSAMD21G18)

- Reads temperature & pressure
- Sends telemetry every second via LoRa
- Stores data on microSD
- Runs the entire primary mission independently

## Raspberry Pi Zero

- Captures images
- Processes IMU + GPS data
- Runs terrain classification (CNN)
- Generates landing heat maps
- Coordinates all secondary mission logic

The Pi communicated with its peripherals using:

- **I²C** for sensors
- **UART** for GPS
- **Camera ribbon** for PiCam
- **SPI / SDIO** for storage

Despite the tiny form factor, it was a surprisingly complete embedded system.

# Mechanical Design

Fitting a Raspberry Pi, camera, parachute mount, servos, and a full power system into a soda-can-sized shell was a miniature engineering challenge.

## CanSat Case

Designed in **Autodesk Fusion 360**, our case used:

- top and bottom plates
- 4 vertical guiding rods
- 6 external mounting holes
- 3D-printed internal supports

This modular design allowed fast inspections and repairs-something we quickly learned was essential.

## Vertical Mount for Raspberry Pi

We created a dedicated 3D-printed vertical frame to hold the Pi Zero and extension boards.
Given the tiny footprint and strict volume limits, this was the only feasible orientation.

# Recovery System Engineering

This was my part of the project-and the steepest learning curve.

## Prototype 1: Parafoil (Clark-Y Profile)

Our first goal was to build a controllable parafoil with:

- non-zero lift-to-drag ratio
- left/right steering via servos
- predictable glide performance

We built it from **nylon fabric** with household strings as suspension lines.
It deployed-but didn't glide. It simply descended like a normal parachute.

We realized we had incorrectly adapted round-parachute formulas to a parafoil, which behaves completely differently aerodynamically.

## Prototype 2: Parafoil (Based on Academic Research)

We rebuilt everything using aerodynamic equations from:

- Om Prakash, _Aerodynamics, Longitudinal Stability and Glide Performance of Parafoil/Payload System_

<Figure src={parashuteWip} alt="Parashute - work in progress" width="40%" />

This time we:

- adjusted aspect ratio
- optimized chord length & canopy span
- changed line thickness to 0.2 mm
- recalculated lift/drag forces

<Figure src={parashute2} alt="Updated parashute design" width="80%" />

The updated parachute flew much better-but had problems:

- too large for the CanSat container
- inconsistent openings
- frequent line tangling
- delayed inflation

Ultimately, we determined the design wasn't reliable enough for the competition constraints.

## Final Design: Round Parachute

Based on NASA and CanSat training materials, we switched to a round parachute-simple, reliable, predictable.

And most importantly: it fit inside the can.

# Testing the System

We tested each subsystem separately before integrating:

## Primary Mission Tests

We verified telemetry accuracy by reading:

- frame number
- pressure
- temperature

Comparing DS18B20 and BMP280 validated sensor accuracy.

## Secondary Mission Tests

Testing the parafoil prototypes took weeks:

- balcony drops
- school-building drops
- indoor glide tests
- multiple redesigns

While the neural network prototypes worked in simulation, real airborne testing was limited by our parachute delays.

# Project Timeline & Iterations

Between November 2018 and March 2019, we built:

- **4 main hardware prototypes**
- **3 parachute generations**
- **2 software stacks**
- **dozens of drop tests**
- **a full outreach program** (blog, shirts, presentations)

It was more than a school project-it was a full engineering cycle.

# Budget & Sponsors

Total budget: **~500 PLN (~116 EUR)**
Most parts were sponsored by:

- **TPU Sp. z o.o.**
- **BOTLAND** (discounts and support)

# Outreach & Public Engagement

We documented the project with:

- a Facebook page
- technical blog posts
- school presentations
- visual branding & logo design
- even an [article in local newspaper](https://tygodnikits.pl/licealisci-biora-udzial-w-kosmicznym-konkursie/ar/13984521)

It was a great introduction to communicating engineering work publicly.

# Conclusion: What I Learned

This project taught me more than any class at the time:

- how to work in a team
- how to design, test, and iterate hardware
- how to integrate software with real sensors
- how to model aerodynamic systems
- how to manage complexity under tight constraints
- how to fail, recover, and move forward

“I Believe I Can Land” was my first real multidisciplinary engineering experience.
It sparked my interest in embedded systems, physics-based modeling, and designing things that interact with the real world-a theme that continues in my later projects.
