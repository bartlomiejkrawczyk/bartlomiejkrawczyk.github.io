# Story

- I've been just begining my long road ahead of me in programming
- I was still in High School, but we had some great ideas to implement and much time on our hands

# Idea

- Create a single platform for all the simple tasks you could order from regular people
- Hire a baby sitter, help with sink, or any other kind of tasks people need
- We would be responsible for connecting people and aggreing on the price
- It was back in 2020, when mobile apps weren't as popular as they are now. And no solution for it was popular at that time in Poland

- The project had a great idea, but at the beginning we weren't aware what was ahead of us.
- In the end we have built from scratch the: REST API + mobile application in android + mobile application in swift (for ios)
- but without funding, and a bit of spaghetti code the project had failed
- we weren't able to raise awareness for our application and the idea failed in the end
- but what we learned has been in dispensable

- Now there are multiple competing apps that achieve the same task, but are backed by million dollar companies.
- eg. Fixly, Booksy - and that's just in Poland alone

# Android

Android still has still been mostly developed in Java.

# Design concepts in mind

We were just learning concepts of design art. We have chosen a color scheme.

Main colors:

- #8DC63F
- #F9DA41
- #414042
- #FFFFFF
