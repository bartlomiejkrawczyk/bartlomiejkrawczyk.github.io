# Wordle Clone

A modern full-stack implementation of **Wordle**, the popular word-guessing game. The player must guess a hidden five-letter word within six attempts. After each guess, the game provides feedback showing:

- letters in the correct position,
- letters that exist in the answer but are placed incorrectly,
- letters that do not appear in the target word at all.

# Implementation

## Database

The application uses a **PostgreSQL 15.2** database (`wordledb`) running in a local Docker environment on port `5432`.
The schema uses basic serial/bigserial types to automate ID generation.

### Data Model (Part 1)

```mermaid
erDiagram
    LANGUAGES {
        SERIAL language_id PK
        VARCHAR_3 code
        VARCHAR_50 name
        VARCHAR_255 flag_url
    }

    WORDS {
        BIGSERIAL word_id PK
        INTEGER language_id FK
        INTEGER word_length
        INTEGER word_number
        VARCHAR_255 word
    }

    USERS {
        SERIAL user_id PK
        VARCHAR_50 login
        VARCHAR_64 password_hash
    }
```

### Data Model (Part 2)

```mermaid
erDiagram
    SESSIONS {
        BIGSERIAL session_id PK
        INTEGER user_id FK
        INTEGER language_id FK
        INTEGER word_length FK
        INTEGER word_number FK
        TIMESTAMP created_date
    }

    GUESSES {
        SERIAL guess_id PK
        BIGINT session_id FK
        INTEGER guess_number
        VARCHAR_15 guess
        TIMESTAMP created_date
    }

    RESULTS {
        SERIAL result_id PK
        INTEGER user_id FK
        BOOLEAN result
        TIMESTAMP created_date
        INTEGER guess_number
    }
```

## Back End

The backend consists of **two independent microservices**:

- `SESSION`
- `AUTHORIZATION`

### Session Service

Manages the game flow. Authenticated users can start a new game session and submit guesses.
The service validates guesses, checks the target word, and returns the result coloring.

### Authorization Service

Handles user registration, login, and security.
Authentication is implemented using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**.

Below is an overview of the security flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor u as User
    participant s as Authorization serivce
    participant db as User Database
    participant r as Resource Server

    u->>s: Authentication Request

    s->>db: Request User Credentials
    db->>s: User Credentials Returned
    s->>s: Match Hash of passed secret and database secret
    s->>s: Generate JWT

    s->>u: Signed JWT

    loop While token is valid
        u->>r: Resource Request
        r->>r: Verify JWT
        r->>u: Resource Returned
    end
```

### Building the Project

The project uses **Gradle** for build automation.
You can run the application with:

```
./gradlew clean build bootRun
```

### Swagger API

Each service exposes a Swagger UI for testing endpoints.
Available after running Docker at:

- [http://localhost:7777/swagger](http://localhost:7777/swagger)
- [http://localhost:7788/swagger](http://localhost:7788/swagger)

## Front End

The frontend consists of three files located:

- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `app.js`

### HTML

Defines the visual structure of the page:

- Main area with the guess grid and visual keyboard
- A header with theme-switching, login, and registration buttons
- Popup windows for login/registration via redirect

### CSS

Styles the interface:

- Colors, fonts, spacing
- Support for **dark** and **light** themes
- Uses Google **Material Icons**

### JavaScript

Handles game logic and user interaction:

- Managing keyboard input (both on-screen and physical keyboard)
- Sending asynchronous `fetch()` requests to the backend
- Rendering guess results and managing session flow

# Running the Application

1. Build and start the Docker environment:

   ```
   docker compose up --build
   ```

2. Wait until all containers finish initialization
   (look for `Application availability state ReadinessState changed to ACCEPTING_TRAFFIC` in the `session` service logs).

3. Open the application in your browser under:

   **[http://localhost](http://localhost)**

   > Important: use `localhost` instead of `127.0.0.1` due to CORS restrictions.
