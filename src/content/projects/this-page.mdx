# Building the Ultimate Portfolio: Performance, Polish, and Power Features

I believe a developer's portfolio should be more than just a list of skills - it should be a demonstration of those skills in practice. That philosophy guided the creation of my personal website. Built on **Astro.js and TypeScript**, this side project became an exercise in pushing the boundaries of modern web development, focusing on performance, accessibility, and delightful user experience.

## The Pillars: 100% on Lighthouse

Achieving a perfect Lighthouse score across the board wasn't just a goal; it was a commitment to best practices.

- **100/100 Performance**
- **100/100 Accessibility (WCAG)**
- **100/100 Best Practices**
- **100/100 SEO**

This required meticulous attention to detail, especially in optimization and adhering to the **WCAG** (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). By embracing Astro.js's default focus on speed and minimal JavaScript, coupled with **Tailwind CSS** for efficient styling, I ensured the site is blazing fast and lightweight, resulting in an optimal experience for every visitor.

## The Feature Deep Dive

Beyond raw metrics, the site is packed with features designed for maximum usability and developer showcase.

### Dynamic Themes: Style on Demand

To prevent design fatigue and show a deeper understanding of responsive and theming architecture, I implemented **10 distinct color schemes**, all powered by pure CSS variables.

The architecture uses two primary states:

1.  **Base Variables:** Neutral grays and a core accent color.
2.  **Dark Mode:** An inverted set of grays applied using a media query, ensuring the theme dynamically adjusts based on the user's system preferences.
3.  **Theme Palettes:** Individual root classes (`:root.theme-green`, `:root.theme-purple`, etc.) override the primary and secondary color variables. This structure allows for easy expansion and maintains consistency across light and dark modes for every palette.

### The Command-Line Interface (CLI) Terminal

For users who prefer a rapid, keyboard-driven interface, I integrated a **dynamic terminal** overlay. Accessible via standard shortcuts (e.g., **ESC** or **Ctrl + Shift + P**), this feature demonstrates advanced frontend interaction and state management.

The terminal currently supports:

- Quick **command filtering**.
- Direct links to social media.
- "Modes" for filtering content, like **project or tag filtering**.

This is designed to mimic the efficiency of developer IDEs like VS Code, offering a powerful way to navigate complex content.

## Content and Internationalization

As a developer working in multiple environments, supporting different languages was key, as was ensuring the platform could handle diverse technical content.

### Multi-Language Support

The website is ready for both my **native Polish** and the primary content language, **English**. This internationalization capability is built directly into the routing and content structure, ensuring a seamless experience regardless of the user's preferred language.

### Robust Markdown and Technical Content

Using Astro.js allows for beautiful, native support for Markdown, meeting the **full GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) specification**. To handle academic and technical content, I integrated powerful parsing tools:

- **Rehype** and **Remark** for processing and transforming Markdown.
- Support for rich features like **dynamic table of contents** and **header links**.
- Direct rendering of complex charts using **Mermaid.js**.
- Native support for mathematical syntax using **LaTeX** via MathJax/Katex, making it ideal for thesis and academic project documentation.

This portfolio is not just a resume; it's a testament to the pursuit of high-quality, performant, and accessible software engineering.
