# Overview

This project implements a multi-layer mobile application (Android, Kotlin) with a cloud backend (Java, Spring WebFlux) that allows users to play classic and custom logic games on a chessboard grid. Beyond standard chess and checkers, the platform enables players to design and play entirely new board-based games by modifying rules, board shapes, and piece behaviors.

<div class="flex flex-row">
  <Figure src={image3} alt="Chess" width="90%" />
  <Figure
    src={image1}
    alt="Chess - in the middle of the gameplay"
    width="90%"
  />
  <Figure src={image4} alt="Checkers" width="90%" />
  <Figure src={image2} alt="Four player chess" width="90%" />
</div>

# Key Features

- **Online and local gameplay** for chess, checkers, and custom games.
- **Configurable rules**, including piece movement, special effects, or custom constraints.
- **Board customization:** arbitrary sizes, rectangular boards, cross-shaped boards.
- **2–4 player support**.
- **Time controls:** Bullet, Blitz, Rapid variants.
- **User accounts, authentication (OAuth2)**, and match history.
- **Reactive real-time communication** using Server-Sent Events (SSE).
- **Cloud-hosted backend** using Spring WebFlux, NoSQL/SQL, and RabbitMQ.
- **CI/CD deployment** to Ubuntu servers on OVH.

# Game Customization

The application exposes a full configuration panel that allows users to design their own variants before the match begins.

## 1. Piece Sets

The game uses custom-designed SVG icons, allowing dynamic recoloring to match the selected theme. Out of the box, it supports:

- Chess: pawn, king, queen, bishop, knight, rook
- Checkers: man, king

The system is prepared for future extension-adding new icons automatically integrates them into customization menus.

## 2. Board Configuration

Users can set:

- **Custom board dimensions** (4×4 to 14×14 for each axis).
- **Board shapes:** rectangle or Greek cross.

## Example Sizes

<div class="flex flex-row">
  <Figure src={board8x8} alt="8x8 board" width="90%" />
  <Figure src={board8x12} alt="8x12 board" width="90%" />
  <Figure src={board10x10} alt="10x10 board" width="90%" />
</div>

## Example Shapes

<div class="flex flex-row">
  <Figure src={cross_9x9} alt="9x9 cross board" width="90%" />
  <Figure src={cross_14x14} alt="14x14 cross board" width="90%" />
</div>

## 3. Player Count

Games can involve **2 to 4 players**, enabling non-standard multiplayer variants.

<Figure src={cross} alt="Cross board for 4 players" />

## 4. Time Controls

Available presets:

- Bullet: 1+2 (1 minute + 2s increment)
- Bullet: 2+1
- Blitz: 3+2
- Rapid: 10+10

# Core Application Functionality

The goal of the thesis was to build a complete online gaming system with:

- Accounts and authentication
- Matchmaking and session management
- Real-time move synchronization
- Configurable rule engine for designing new game types

Built-in games include:

- **Chess**
- **Checkers**
- **Atomic Chess**
- **Mini Chess**
- **Progressive Chess**
- **Anti Chess**
- **Four Player Chess**

But players can also define entirely new variants using the rules interface:

<div class="flex flex-row">
  <Figure
    src={piece_placement}
    alt="Piece placement customization"
    width="90%"
  />
  <Figure src={move_customization_2} alt="Move customization" width="90%" />
  <Figure
    src={piece_promotion_customization}
    alt="Piece promotion customization"
    width="90%"
  />
</div>

<div class="flex flex-row">
  <Figure src={rule_customization} alt="Rule customization" width="80%" />
  <Figure src={piece_customization} alt="Piece customization" width="80%" />
</div>

Supported customizations include:

- Altered movement rules
- Special effects
- Non-standard board sizes and shapes
- Additional players

This system effectively becomes a _board-game creation platform_.

# Real-Time Architecture & Concurrency

A critical part of the system is real-time synchronization between players. Events flow through:

1. User sends an action (move event).
2. Stateless backend retrieves the current session state from the database.
3. The move is validated.
4. A transactional update ensures no conflicting writes occur.
5. The event is published to RabbitMQ.
6. Clients subscribe to a dedicated SSE channel.
7. All new events are pushed live to connected players.

This guarantees consistency even when multiple users send simultaneous actions.

<Figure src={session_item} alt="Session events" />

SSE (Server-Sent Events) enables lightweight, real-time push communication. The backend emits both move events and keep-alive signals to maintain connection stability.

<div class="flex flex-row">
  <Figure src={checkers_gameplay} alt="Checkers gameplay" width="80%" />
  <Figure src={chess_gameplay} alt="Chess gameplay" width="80%" />
</div>

# Example Backend SSE Endpoint

```java
@GetMapping(path = "{sessionId}", produces = MediaType.TEXT_EVENT_STREAM_VALUE)
public Flux<ServerSentEvent<EventDto>> listenForEvents(@PathVariable long sessionId) {
    var moves = sessionService.listenForEvents(sessionId)
        .map(eventMappers::map)
        .map(it -> ServerSentEvent.<EventDto>builder().data(it).build());

    var keepAlive = Flux.interval(Duration.of(15, ChronoUnit.SECONDS))
        .map(it -> ServerSentEvent.<EventDto>builder().event("keep-alive").build());

    return Flux.merge(moves, keepAlive);
}
```

<br />

# Example Android Client Listener

```kotlin
override fun listenForEvents(sessionId: Long): Flow<Event> = flow {
    coroutineScope {
        sessionApi.listenForEvents(sessionId)
            .byteStream()
            .bufferedReader()
            .useLines { sequence ->
                sequence.filter { it.startsWith("data:") }
                    .filter { isActive }
                    .map { it.removePrefix("data:").trim() }
                    .map { objectMapper.readValue(it, EventDto::class.java) }
                    .map { eventMapper.map(it) }
                    .forEach { emit(it) }
            }
    }
}.flowOn(ioDispatcher)
```

<br />

# Settings & Personalization

<Figure src={settings} alt="Settings screen" />

A key part of the application is its extensive customization module, allowing players to tailor the entire experience to their preferences. Users can switch between interface languages, enable or disable sound effects, and choose from multiple visual themes that completely change the look and feel of the board. The app also supports dynamic board scaling—regardless of device or orientation, the layout automatically adjusts tile sizes, piece proportions, and UI elements to maintain clarity and comfort during gameplay.

<div class="flex flex-row">
  <Figure src={language_en} alt="Language settings - English" width="80%" />
  <Figure src={language_pl} alt="Language settings - Polish" width="80%" />
  <Figure src={sound} alt="Sound settings" width="80%" />
</div>

<div class="flex flex-row">
  <Figure src={theme_1} alt="Theme example 1" width="90%" />
  <Figure src={theme_2} alt="Theme example 2" width="90%" />
  <Figure src={theme_3} alt="Theme example 3" width="90%" />
  <Figure src={theme_4} alt="Theme example 4" width="90%" />
</div>

# Summary

The final product is a complete, cloud-driven mobile system for online board games. It supports:

- Standard chess & checkers
- Fully custom rule-based games
- Custom boards and shapes
- Multiplayer beyond two players
- Real-time gameplay via SSE

The combination of reactive programming, scalable architecture, and flexible gameplay design makes the system a strong foundation for future extensions.

# Future Work

Planned or possible expansions:

- Publishing the Android app to Google Play.
- Vertical or horizontal scaling in Cloud environment.
- Additional languages and themes.
