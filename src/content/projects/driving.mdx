# Driver's License

I hold a category AM, B, and B1 driver's license, received on 2019-06-11 (valid until 2034-06-11).  
I've been an active driver since 2019, comfortable with both automatic and manual transmissions.

I passed the written exam with full marks.
The practical exam took me two attempts - nerves got me the first time, but I passed confidently on the second.

Below are some of the cars I've recently driven.
