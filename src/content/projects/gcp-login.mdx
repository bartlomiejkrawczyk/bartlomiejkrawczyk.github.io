# GCP Login

[Application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.grupapolsat) that generates one-time logon passwords for Grupa Polsat in accordance with the mOTP protocol.  
The app provides a secure, offline method of generating time-based access codes using a shared secret and a short user PIN.

## Mobile One-Time Passwords (mOTP)

mOTP (Mobile One-Time Password) is a lightweight authentication protocol designed for mobile devices.  
It generates temporary passwords based on three elements:

1. **User PIN** - a short, memorable code known only to the user.
2. **Shared Secret** - a cryptographic token exchanged during profile provisioning.
3. **Current Timestamp** - ensures the password is valid only for a very short window (typically 60 seconds).

The generation algorithm combines these values and produces a hash that is truncated into an 8-digit one-time password.  
Because the process is entirely offline and relies only on local computations, the app does **not require internet access** to function.  
This makes it extremely secure and resilient against network-based attacks.

## Profile Provisioning

The application supports two methods of provisioning user profiles:

1. **QR Code Provisioning** -  
   The recommended and user-friendly approach.  
   The user scans a QR code displayed on the company’s web application.  
   This code contains all necessary provisioning data, automatically linking the generated profile to the correct domain account.  
   The app uses _Google Play Services Vision_ to perform QR decoding with high accuracy and speed.

2. **Manual Entry** -  
   The user manually copies a Secret from the mobile app into the web application.  
   This Secret becomes the link between the device and the user’s domain account in Grupa Polsat systems.  
   It is a reliable fallback method when QR code provisioning is not available.

## Temporary Password Generation

The temporary password generation screen allows the user to generate a valid one-time password with just a few taps.

- First, the user enters a **simple 4-digit PIN**.
- The application combines the PIN with the securely stored Secret and the current timestamp.
- A one-time password is generated, valid for **60 seconds** from the moment of creation.

This generated password can then be copied and used to log in to supported Grupa Polsat services.  
The process is fast, offline, and protected by device-level encryption and the Android keystore.

## Story

This project has a personal origin story and marks a milestone in my development journey.

GCP Login was one of my **first real-world, paid software projects**.  
At the time, I had been studying computer science for about a year and was actively experimenting with Android development, eager to build something practical.

My dad was working at Grupa Polsat, and through his connection, I had the opportunity to take on this contract.  
What started as a small assignment for them turned into a complete Android application involving cryptography, secure storage, QR code processing, UI design, and backend integration.

It was the first time I built a product that became part of an actual company workflow, and it helped shape my interest in mobile security and clean, maintainable Android architecture.

Today, it is **actively used by employees across the entire Grupa Polsat organization** and has accumulated **10,000+ downloads**, becoming an important part of the company's authentication workflow.

Looking back, GCP Login played an important role in:

- giving me my first experience delivering a production-ready application for a real client,
- teaching me how to translate requirements into practical features,
- and building confidence to take on more complex and ambitious work.
