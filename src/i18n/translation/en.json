    "header": "About",
    "content": "I am a highly driven Full-Stack Systems Engineer specializing in creating reliable, scalable, and maintainable IT solutions. My technical foundation is built on deep expertise in Java/Kotlin/Spring for robust backend services, supplemented by strong polyglot skills in Rust and Python for performance-critical and AI-driven applications. I have a proven track record in architecting and deploying cloud-native, distributed systems, mastering patterns like Microservices, CQRS, and Event Sourcing using Docker and Kubernetes. Beyond core development, I possess a strong background in Artificial Intelligence, Optimization (MIP/OR-Tools), and full-stack deployment, including mobile (Android) and modern web development using React.js/Astro.js. My diverse project portfolio - spanning official, deployed mobile applications (10k+ downloads) to complex thesis work in AI and optimization - reflects a commitment to end-to-end engineering excellence and the practical application of advanced computer science principles."
